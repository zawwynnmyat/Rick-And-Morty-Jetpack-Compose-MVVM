# Rick And Morty App with Jetpack Compose and MVVM Architecture

This android app, Rick and Morty Universe, utilized [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/) and Jetpack Compose. The API is affiliated with
the [Rick and Morty TV Series](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2861424/), and it includes thorough information about characters, episodes and locations involved in the entire series.
I built this app as a mean of my first Jetpack Compose portfolio.

You can download apk file this app from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RFggZRFfL9zhomeeiP7nVETpF0S6lRMs/view?usp=sharing).

## Core Features
It has the functionalities described below.
* Revealing all characters, locations and episodes with **paginated API response**
* Caching fetch data for offline utilization
* Instant search for characters
* Bookmark your favorite characters
* Sort you favorite characters by name in ascending and descending orders and ID.
* Character details and developer infos

## Tech Stack
* [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose) : Jetpack Compose is Androidâ€™s recommended modern toolkit for building native UI. It simplifies and accelerates UI development on Android. Quickly bring your app to life with less code, powerful tools, and intuitive Kotlin APIs.
* [Dagger Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) : utilized for dependency injection
* [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) : used for working with REST API
* [okHttp interceptor](https://github.com/square/okhttp/blob/master/okhttp-logging-interceptor/README.md) : to cache API Responses and combined with Retrofit
* [Room Database](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/room) : to save/remove/order favorite characters
* [Paging 3](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging/v3-overview) : to pagniate data, including list of characters in home page and search results, locations and episodes in 20 items per page
* [Data Store Preferences](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/datastore) : to save sorting data (ie: Sort by name in ascending, descending and characters' ID)
* [Lottie Composition](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie/blob/master/android-compose.md) : to visualize Lottie animations in search prompt, empty search result and empty favorite screen.
* [Splash Screen API](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/launch/splash-screen) : to show a splash screen while the app's process isn't running.
* [Coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) : Kotlin coroutines
* [Flow](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow) : Flows are built on top of coroutines and can provide multiple values. A flow is conceptually a stream of data that can be computed asynchronously.
* [ViewModlel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) : Designed to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way. The ViewModel class allows data to survive configuration changes such as screen rotations.
* [Compose Navigation](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/navigation) : Component that allows easier implementation of navigation from composables.
* [System UI Controller](https://google.github.io/accompanist/systemuicontroller/) : System UI Controller provides easy-to-use utilities for updating the System UI bar colors within Jetpack Compose.
* [Coil](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/compose/) : to load network images
